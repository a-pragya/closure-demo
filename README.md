This React app has an App component and a Button component. 

The App component manages state for toggling paragraph and enabling toggle. Button component uses React.memo() for optimization. The toggle handler function in App component uses useCallback() so that the function is not recreated everytime the component is rendered. 

The toggle handler function contains enableToggle state value. Since this forms a closure, the enableToggle value must be added to useCallback dependency so that enableToggle value for toggle handler function updates. Otherwise, the toggle handler function will use the initial enableToggle value(set to false).
